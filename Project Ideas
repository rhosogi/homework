### Project Questions:
### 
1. What is the question you hope to answer? 
.. *Over the last decade,
companies have been investing in non-meat options as a countermeasure to
the growing public’s health and economic concerns.

2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
.. *Using
the 2010-2014 [Consumer Expenditure
survey][http://www.bls.gov/cex/pumdhome.htm] collected by the US Census
Bureau

3. What do you know about the data so far? 
..* I know that there are a
few different formats and that I need to be able to choose one to gather
a sufficient amount of data for an extensive view of food buying trends.

4. Why did you choose this topic? 
..* I chose this topic because I’m
interested in the food industry from the data side and how potential
trends could help with research and development on a greater scale.
Already we’re seeing large tech companies and venture capitalists
investing in non-meat R&D, from creating meat-like substances from kelp,
to non-dairy mayonnaise. In conjunction with the growing fears
surrounding GMO’s and non-organic produce, I think that there could be
some valuable information surrounding grocery-buying patterns in
American homes, especially at different socioeconomic levels (more
advanced and if I have time or can even do that). With that in mind, I
think it would be in the USDA’s interest in creating new measures for
these laboratory-created foods, especially within the next 10 years to
maintain healthy standards. The more information from the onset of these
lab creations and how they will affect future health will be paramount
in other fields with growing food concerns.
